Master thesis in the Computational Population Biology Group (Erasmus MC).
Developed a computational framework ([STEAP](https://github.com/erwinerdem/STEAP)) which elucidates more on the complex genomics of brain (imaging) phenotypes by combining GWAS with scRNA-seq data. Supervised by dr. Gennady Roshchupkin and prof.dr. Steven Kushner.
* Incorporate data from various (public) resources (NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, GWAS atlas, descartes) to assess the framework
